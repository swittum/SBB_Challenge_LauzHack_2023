# SBB Challenge LauzHack 2023
## Enhancing Mobility With Interconnected Solutions
This repository has been created in the course of the LauzHack 2023 Hackathon hosted by EPFL in Lausanne. It has been created in strong cooperation with @fwalcher. To run the code, clone the repository to your local computer and run
```bash
$foo@bar:~$ pip -r install requirements.txt
```
in the command line. You will then be able to execute the main.py script by running
```python
python3 main.py
```
The idea of this project is to convince frequent car drivers in Switzerland to partly switch to public transport whenever it is faster to drive to an SBB Park&Ride station by car, and then continue the journey by train.
